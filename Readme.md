Request Provisioning: The user submits a provisioning request through a UI or Azure Pipeline. This request includes the desired node configurations and quantity.

Infrastructure Provisioning - Terraform Setup: The provisioning request is processed by Terraform, which uses Azure APIs to set up the necessary virtual machines (VMs). Based on user input, VMs are configured with the appropriate specifications. Additional networking resources such as Virtual Networks (VNets), subnets, Network Security Groups (NSGs), and network interfaces are provisioned as required.

Configuration Management - Ansible Execution: Post the VM provisioning, Ansible is activated to manage the configuration of these machines. By executing a set of Ansible playbooks and roles, the VMs are equipped with necessary internal services like Docker or Kubernetes.

Docker/Kubernetes Deployment: Once VMs are prepared and services are set, the deployment phase begins. A Docker or Kubernetes image of the Geth client, which contains essential details like network ID, genesis block, boot nodes, and other network parameters, is pulled from a cloud image repository and deployed across each VM.

Geth Client Initialization: With the image deployment complete, a startup script or a service manager (like systemd) is used to start up the Geth client on each machine. This triggers the synchronization process with the private Ethereum network.

Activating Validator Functionality: With the Geth client up and running, the validation process can be started. This is done by triggering a staking transaction from the Ethereum accounts associated with each node, thus activating their validator capabilities.

Resource Supervision: Resource supervision is enabled using Azure Monitor or Prometheus to keep an eye on the containers or pods running the Geth client on the VMs. Essential metrics like block propagation time, network latency, and resource usage are tracked. Alerts are set up to notify in case of any significant deviations or anomalies.

Private Key Storage and Management - Azure Key Vault: For secure handling of the private keys associated with Ethereum accounts of the validator nodes, Azure Key Vault is utilized. This provides a secure and reliable way to store and retrieve these critical keys.

A user just needs to trigger the setup.sh script and it will take care of the entire setup.
